# About
A Discord moderation bot including cmds such as kicking, banning, warning users, clearing previous messages, sending announcements, and more.

## Setup
Get the bot token from the Discord Developers Console with the necessary permissions, ensure that you include slash command permissions. Afterwards, add the token to your config.py file. Additionally, insert the role IDs for your admin roles into config.py and you're all set.

## Note
- I assume you have a basic understanding of Python/Discord.py.
- This is a fully open-source project, and you have permission to freely copy, modify, and distribute it.
